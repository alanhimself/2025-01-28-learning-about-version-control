# “Learning about Version Control”
## Alan Lee

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

Question 1:
what I like most about version control is that I feel like I am becomign a professional instead of saving things like cancer_data_version 1, cancer_data_version_1_group_edited, etc. each time new things happen. I also like that it feels like I am learning the tools to work with other people instead of by myself :)

Git is frustrating because none of this is intuitive to me yet. I understand the theory of how it works but its not intuitive to call commands or go through the steps to pull, stage, commit, and push yet. I am too used to just work on something and save it. 

I am sure I will get it in the end though! I do see the value of it.
